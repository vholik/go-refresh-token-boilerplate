# Golang gin refresh jwt token boilerplate

### The main motivation to create this project was to not worry about authentication jazz and more focus on the logic of the application.

This project under the hood is using JWT access and refresh tokens and domain driven architecture.

Also you should have .env file like this

`DB_URL=...
JWT_SECRET=...
TOKEN_TTL=...`
